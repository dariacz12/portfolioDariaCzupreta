Start as simple as To DO, Doing, or Done - or build a workflow custom fit your needs. Tasker offers adding files, checklists, covers, and many other actions with tasks. Just sign up, create a board, and youâ€™re off! Simple, flexible, and powerful. All it takes are boards, lists, and cards to get a clear view of what needs to get done.",
